Together with 3 other DIY labels (Cipher Productions, Lonktaar & Underground Pollution Records) i managed to put out one of the nastiest digital noise singles to ever be pressed onto vinyl! Japan obsessed weirdness from Italy with the \"pinku\" theme stretching across the whole release brilliantly!
