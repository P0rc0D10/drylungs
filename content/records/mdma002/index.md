Enjoyed a commission from this serbian artist and with the help of 3 other DIY labels (NHDIYSTREC, Rauha Turva & Underground Pollution Records) we managed to release this cost efficient plate from it! First and only time I used a folded A4 sheet as cover to safe money but should've just spent a bit more and go for a proper ones, gotta learn from past mistakes.
