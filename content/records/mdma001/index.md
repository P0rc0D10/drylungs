Not being able to continue with my original LP plans I decided to go for 7" Singles instead. As luck would have it my friend Wolfgang from [Hirntrust Grindmedia](http://www.hirntrust.at/) was looking for a label to co-release this plate with and since the belgian underground content was to my liking I had to jump on that opportunity!
