Been talking to James Miller about a possible release for a while but since his catalogue is so vast it was always a problem to pick something from it. Easiest solution proofed to be him just making brand new tracks that were basically tailormade to fit my label and rearranged over quite some time before everyone was fully satisfied with it. All the work really paid off tho as it turned out to be one of the most danceable noise plates in recent history!
