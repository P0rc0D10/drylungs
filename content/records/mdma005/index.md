When John Wiese, who always was and still is one of my favorite noise people in the USA today, asked if I was interested in releasing a Sissy Spacek recording from "December 31st 2014 in Hill Street, Los Angeles" it cant have been more than a week til everything was ready for production and my friend Wolfgang from [Hirntrust Grindmedia](http://www.hirntrust.at/) said he was down to co-release this incredibly brutal noise & drums plate!
