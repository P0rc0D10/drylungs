As a longtime admirer of Lucas Abela aka Justice Yeldham when I read that he is planning to do a Pic 12" featuring Live recordings with the help of crowd funding my interest was sparked immediately! Add the fact that my pressing plant was having a special deal on Picture Disc Pressings during that time and that Lucas offered to help sell my copies too once his are out, it only made sense to arrange a half/half co-release with "dualpLOVER" from australia.
