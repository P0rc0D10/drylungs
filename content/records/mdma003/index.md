When Lasse Marhaug wrote if I was interested in doing a Single with stuff he recorded together with Otomo Yoshihide on the 6th February 2011 at Tokyo Superdeluxe, I was straight up honoured. It only took a handful of emails til Marhaug came up with a complete concept for the release including that specially printed gold letter cover, was a true joy and minimal effort on my part to release these legendary artists!
