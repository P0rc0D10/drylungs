Had to look twice when there was a message from the legendary Kazuyuki Kishimo in my mail box asking if I wanna release something with him! If one of your alltime favorite artists contacts you on his own there really only is one right answer & to make this release as grande as it needed to be I had to get Wolfgang from \"Hirntrust Grindmedia\" on board too for our third co-release together! Can't begin to state how happy I am with every aspect of the end result.
