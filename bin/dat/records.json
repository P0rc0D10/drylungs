Incredibly happy with the end result and the feedback/orders received right away the plan to continue this \"Noise Live in Vienna as HQ LP releases\" was only logically but little did I know the austrian post office was about to foil this plan by adjusting postage prices to up to three times than what they used to be which basically stopped all international orders over night ...",
