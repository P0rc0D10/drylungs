		Noisecore, Grindcore and Vinyl are 3 of the most beloved things in my life.
		So it only came natural to start a diy vinyl only noise/grind label to try and support the (local) scene!
	</p>
	<p>
		Started out with the idea to do only "live in vienna" lps on 180g wax with highest possible quality!
		After releasing <a href="records/DLR001" title="DLR001">Merzbow &amp; Balazs Pandi LP</a> the austrian post office changed prices so that shipping any 12" is 14€ inside .eu and up to 20€ (shipping alone!) for the rest of the world.
		Thats why i had to switch into releasing 7" only now... which is at least a good thing since one can afford way more ep releases and can help underground artists to be heard!
	</p>
	<p>
		I decided to start a small mailorder so one can chose from a handful of things to "save on postage" and not just dry lungs releases, which also helped expanding my private collection immensly.
		All the stuff is sold at basic costs, i do not overcharge shipping or add any fees whatsoever, all the money is used exclusively for label activities!
		The non-7" stuff usually is made up from doubles of my collection and unwanted 2nd hand stuff!
	</p>
	<p>
		Decided the best way to start a nice stock to choose from is to ask friends from other labels for their new grind/noise 7inchers on release, thus far i aim to offer new releases from:
		<a href="http://bonesbrigaderecs.com/">Bones Brigade (fr)</a>, <a href="http://fourthdimensionrecords.blogspot.com/">Fourth Dimension Records / Lumberton Trading Company (pl)</a>, <a href="http://freak-animal.net/">Freak Animal Records (fi)</a>, <a href="http://www.hirntrust.at/">Hirntrust Grind Media (at)</a>, <a href="https://www.discogs.com/label/53220-Quasi-Pop-Records">Quasi Pop Records (ua)</a>
	</p>
	<p>
		Will try to also keep some of my favourite artists hard to get / fastly outselling eps in here by ordering multiple copies along when ordering for my private collection.
		If the prices are high like for that agoraphobic nosebleed flexi, i was prolly fucked by the customs and had to pay a lot of import taxes.
	</p>
	<p>
		Trade offers are also always welcome but usually the postage costs make trading really exhausting.
	</p>
	<p>
		Open for submissions of underground noise, co-releases with other labels only tho, please dont expect me to release a 7" with you on my own unless i contacted you!
