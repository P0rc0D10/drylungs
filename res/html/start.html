            <section class="about">     <p>Noisecore, Grindcore and Vinyl are 3 of the most beloved things in my life.<br>
        So it only came natural to start a diy vinyl only noise/grind label to try and support the (local) scene!</p>
        <p>Started out with the idea to do only "live in vienna" lps on 180g wax with highest possible quality!<br>
        After releasing Merzbow &amp; Balazs Pandi LP the austrian post office changed prices so that shipping any 12" is 14€ inside .eu and up to 20€ (shipping alone!) for the rest of the world.<br>
        Thats why i had to switch into releasing 7" only now... which is at least a good thing since one can afford way more ep releases and can help underground artists to be heard!</p>
        <p>I decided to start a small mailorder so one can chose from a handful of things to "save on postage" and not just dry lungs releases, which also helped expanding my private collection immensly.<br>
        All the stuff is sold at basic costs, i do not overcharge shipping or add any fees whatsoever, all the money is used exclusively for label activities!
        The non-7" stuff usually is made up from doubles of my collection and unwanted 2nd hand stuff!</p>
        <p>Decided the best way to start a nice stock to choose from is to ask friends from other labels for their new grind/noise 7inchers on release, thus far i aim to offer new releases from:
        Bones Brigade (.fr), Fourth Dimension Records / Lumberton Trading Company (.pl), Freak Animal Records (.fi), Hirntrust Grind Media (.at) &amp; Quasi Pop Records (.ua)</p>
        <p>Will try to also keep some of my favourite artists hard to get / fastly outselling eps in here by ordering multiple copies along when ordering for my private collection.<br>
        If the prices are high like for that agoraphobic nosebleed flexi, i was prolly fucked by the customs and had to pay a lot of import taxes.</p>
        <p>Trade offers are also always welcome but usually the postage costs make trading really exhausting... :(</p>
        <p>Open for submissions of underground noise, co-releases with other labels only tho, please dont expect me to release a 7" with you on my own unless i contacted you!</p>
